# Innovation Index Toolkit - Technical Overview

**Overview:**
The Innovation Index Toolkit is a client-side JavaScript application designed to assess an organization's innovation capabilities. It dynamically generates a survey, calculates scores, and visualizes results using Chart.js. This tool is built for ease of deployment and requires no backend services.

**Key Features:**

* **Dynamic Survey Generation:**
    * Presents 8 standardized questions across two scale types (Excellence & Likelihood).
    * Utilizes responsive radio button grids for user input.
    * Ensures accessibility through ARIA attributes.
* **Automated Scoring:**
    * Calculates total and average scores based on user responses.
    * Provides category-based average scores for deeper insights.
    * Assigns performance tiers (Low, Medium, High) for quick analysis.
* **Data Visualization:**
    * Generates a radar chart using Chart.js to display innovation dimensions.
    * Includes color-coded performance tiers for visual clarity.
    * Visualizes category average scores.
    * Scale of 0-5 for all data.
* **Client-Side Implementation:**
    * Pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for easy deployment.
    * No server-side dependencies.

**Technical Architecture:**

* **Configuration Objects:**
    * `QUESTIONS`: Stores survey questions with scale and category data.
    * `SCALES`: Defines response labels for each scale type.
* **Form Generation:**
    * Dynamically creates question cards with radio inputs on page load.
* **Scoring System:**
    * Calculates scores and assigns performance tiers based on defined logic.
* **Visualization Controller:**
    * Uses Chart.js to render a radar chart and display results.
* **Styling:**
    * Uses a mobile first grid, and responsive styling.

**File Structure:**

* `index.html`: Main UI structure.
* `styles.css`: Responsive styling.
* `app.js`: Core logic and charting.

**Dependencies:**

* Chart.js (v3.9.1+): For data visualization.
* Modern web browser (ES6+ support).

**Deployment:**

* Host HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files on any web server.
* Include Chart.js CDN.
* No backend required.

**Future Enhancements:**

* User authentication and data persistence.
* Exportable reports (PDF, CSV).
* Comparative analysis with industry benchmarks.
* Enhanced UI/UX with interactive elements.
* More detailed performance tier descriptions.

**Troubleshooting:**

* **Chart not rendering:** Verify Chart.js CDN connection.
* **Radio values missing:** Ensure all questions are answered and implement client-side validation.
* **Mobile layout broken:** Verify viewport meta tag.
* **Incorrect score calculation:** Verify question categories and scale values.
